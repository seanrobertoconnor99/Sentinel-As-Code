# AGENTS.md

Cross-tool agent guidance for Sentinel-As-Code. Recognised by GitHub
Copilot, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, and other agentic coding tools that
look for `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.

This file is a thin pointer — every agent / tool should follow the
canonical instructions in
[`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md).

## TL;DR for agents

1. **Read [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) first.**
   It carries the conventions (en-GB spelling, no em-dashes,
   commit-message format, no AI co-author trailers, etc.) that the rest
   of the docs assume.
2. **Read [`Docs/README.md`](Docs/README.md) second.** It is the
   table of contents for every concern in the repo.
3. **Path-scoped instructions** under
   [`.github/instructions/`](.github/instructions) carry per-folder
   schema rules and conventions. Copilot loads them automatically based
   on the file you're editing; other agents should read the matching
   `<area>.instructions.md` before editing files in that area.
4. **Reusable prompts** under [`.github/prompts/`](.github/prompts)
   are slash commands for repeatable tasks (new rule, new test,
   review-a-rule, regenerate-deps). Copilot exposes them in chat;
   other agents can read them as task templates.
5. **Custom agents** under [`.github/agents/`](.github/agents)
   are persona configurations recognised by GitHub Copilot Chat
   (github.com), Copilot cloud agent, Copilot CLI, VS Code,
   JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode. Thirteen agents in two tiers:

   **Persona-broad (5)** — `repo-explorer`, `rule-author`,
   `content-editor`, `rule-tuner`, `code-explainer`. Pick one
   based on the kind of help you want.

   **Engineering specialists (8)** — `pipeline-engineer`,
   `powershell-engineer`, `bicep-engineer`, `kql-engineer`,
   `test-engineer`, `security-reviewer`, `drift-engineer`,
   `dependencies-engineer`. Pick one when the task is firmly in
   one engineering specialism.

   Other agentic tools can treat the `.agent.md` files as role
   definitions.

## Hard rules

- **Never push to `main` directly.** All changes via PR.
- **Never push to `auto/*` branches.** Bot-managed.
- **Never hand-edit `dependencies.json`.** Auto-derived. Run
  `./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Generate` instead.
- **Never include AI / LLM references in commit messages or
  `Co-Authored-By` trailers.** This includes Claude, Anthropic,
  ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.
- **Never use em-dashes (—) in new prose.** Use hyphens or
  parenthetical phrasing.
- **Always run Pester locally before pushing**: `./Tools/Invoke-PRValidation.ps1`.

## What to do for common tasks

| You want to... | Read | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add a Sentinel analytical rule | [Docs/Content/Analytical-Rules.md](Docs/Content/Analytical-Rules.md) | Agent `rule-author` (works on github.com + VS Code) or prompt `/new-analytical-rule` (VS Code) |
| Add a hunting query | [Docs/Content/Hunting-Queries.md](Docs/Content/Hunting-Queries.md) | Agent `rule-author` or prompt `/new-hunting-query` |
| Add a Defender XDR detection | [Docs/Content/Defender-Custom-Detections.md](Docs/Content/Defender-Custom-Detections.md) | Agent `rule-author` or prompt `/new-defender-detection` |
| Add a Pester test | [Docs/Tests/Pester-Tests.md](Docs/Tests/Pester-Tests.md) | Prompt `/new-pester-test` (VS Code) |
| Tune an existing rule's threshold / severity | The rule file itself | Agent `rule-tuner` |
| Understand how a piece of the repo works | [Docs/README.md](Docs/README.md) | Agent `repo-explorer` |
| Explain a rule's KQL | The rule file | Agent `code-explainer` |
| Edit a workflow / pipeline, port an ADO change to GH, or diagnose a CI/CD failure | [Docs/Pipelines/README.md](Docs/Pipelines/README.md) | Agent `pipeline-engineer` |
| Add a function to `Sentinel.Common` or refactor a script | [Docs/Deploy/Scripts.md](Docs/Deploy/Scripts.md) | Agent `powershell-engineer` |
| Edit a Bicep template | [Docs/Infra/Bicep.md](Docs/Infra/Bicep.md) | Agent `bicep-engineer` |
| Optimise a KQL query (performance, parser extraction, watchlist promotion) | [`.github/instructions/kql-queries.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/kql-queries.instructions.md) | Agent `kql-engineer` |
| Add coverage / refactor a Pester suite | [Docs/Tests/Pester-Tests.md](Docs/Tests/Pester-Tests.md) | Agent `test-engineer` |
| Security-review a playbook / script / workflow | The file in question | Agent `security-reviewer` |
| Triage a drift auto-PR or fix the drift detector | [Docs/Tools/Sentinel-Drift-Detection.md](Docs/Tools/Sentinel-Drift-Detection.md) | Agent `drift-engineer` |
| Fix wrong output in `dependencies.json` or extend the KQL discovery extractor | [Docs/Tools/Dependency-Manifest.md](Docs/Tools/Dependency-Manifest.md) | Agent `dependencies-engineer` |
| Refresh `dependencies.json` (routine regeneration) | [Docs/Tools/Dependency-Manifest.md](Docs/Tools/Dependency-Manifest.md) | Prompt `/regenerate-deps` |

## Test before you ship

Always run the Pester suite locally before opening a PR:

```powershell
./Tools/Invoke-PRValidation.ps1 -RepoPath .
```

Five-job CI gate on every PR to `main`:

- `validate` — Pester suites
- `bicep-build` — `az bicep build`
- `arm-validate` — `Test-AzResourceGroupDeployment` template validation (OIDC)
- `kql-validate` — Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Language parser
- `dependency-manifest` — `dependencies.json` drift gate

A failing gate blocks merge. See
[Docs/Tests/Pester-Tests.md](Docs/Tests/Pester-Tests.md).
