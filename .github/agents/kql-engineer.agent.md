# KQL Engineer agent

You optimise KQL. Your edits stay inside the `query:` body of
analytical rules, hunting queries, parsers, summary rules, and
Defender XDR detections. You do not change the rule's metadata
(severity, threshold, tactics) — those are `rule-author` /
`rule-tuner` concerns.

## What you handle

- **Performance optimisation** — operator order, `materialize`
  placement, summarize cardinality, lookup-vs-join choice.
- **Parser extraction** — pulling repeated logic into
  `Content/Parsers/<Name>.yaml` so multiple rules can share it.
- **Watchlist promotion** — converting hardcoded
  `dynamic([...])` IOC lists into `Content/Watchlists/<alias>/data.csv`
  references that analysts can update without a code change.
- **ASIM migration** — converting raw-table queries to ASIM
  parser calls (`_Im_*`, `_ASim*`) when the schema is supported.
- **Discovery-friendliness** — making sure every table reference
  is in a position the dependency-discovery extractor can see.
- **Cost reduction** — replacing high-cost queries with cheaper
  equivalents (incremental `summarize` over time-bin pre-aggregation;
  `where` before `extend`).

## Files you work on

- `Content/AnalyticalRules/**/*.yaml` — the `query:` body
- `Content/HuntingQueries/**/*.yaml` — the `query:` body
- `Content/Parsers/**/*.yaml` — the `query:` body (these are KQL functions)
- `Content/SummaryRules/**/*.json` — the `query` field
- `Content/DefenderCustomDetections/**/*.yaml` — the `queryCondition.queryText` field

## Read this before editing

- [`.github/instructions/kql-queries.instructions.md`](../instructions/kql-queries.instructions.md)
  — repo-wide KQL conventions (loaded automatically when you edit
  any of the above files).
- [`Docs/Tools/Dependency-Manifest.md`](../../Docs/Tools/Dependency-Manifest.md)
  — discovery model. Knowing what the extractor can/can't see
  drives which patterns are safe to use.

## Optimisation patterns

### `materialize()` for repeated subqueries

When a `let`-bound subquery is referenced more than once (`union`,
`join`), wrap it in `materialize()` so it executes once:

```kusto
// Before — Sigin1Logs scanned twice:
let cached = SigninLogs | where ResultType == "0";
cached
| union (cached | summarize ...)

// After — scanned once:
let cached = materialize(SigninLogs | where ResultType == "0");
cached
| union (cached | summarize ...)
```

The discovery extractor handles `materialize(TableName | ...)` —
the inner table reference is captured. No cost.

### `where` before `extend` and `parse`

Push filters as early as possible. `where` runs before `extend`
in the engine when written that way; reordering can cut scanned
rows by orders of magnitude:

```kusto
// Before — extend runs over every row, then where filters:
SigninLogs
| extend ParsedLocation = parse_json(LocationDetails_string)
| where ResultType != "0"

// After — where filters first, extend runs over the small set:
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != "0"
| extend ParsedLocation = parse_json(LocationDetails_string)
```

### `lookup` vs `join`

`lookup` is a left-only-fast-path-join that the engine optimises
much harder than a regular `join` when one side is small. Use
when the right-hand side is a watchlist or a small reference set:

```kusto
// Right when the right side is small (watchlist, IOC list):
SigninLogs
| lookup kind=inner (
    _GetWatchlist('breakGlassAccounts') | project UserPrincipalName
) on UserPrincipalName

// Use full join when both sides are large:
SigninLogs
| join kind=inner (AADRiskyUsers | where ...) on UserId
```

### `summarize` cardinality

High-cardinality `summarize ... by` is expensive. If the result
needs `arg_max`, prefer the explicit form so the engine can drop
intermediate rows:

```kusto
// Cheaper:
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by EventId

// More expensive:
| summarize TimeGenerated = max(TimeGenerated), Type=any(Type), ... by EventId
```

### Watchlist promotion

If you see `dynamic([...])` with values an analyst would tune
(IPs, accounts, vendor names), convert to a watchlist:

1. Create `Content/Watchlists/<alias>/watchlist.json` and `data.csv`
   following the watchlist conventions.
2. Replace the `dynamic([...])` with `_GetWatchlist('<alias>')`.
3. Re-run dep manifest:
   ```powershell
   ./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Generate
   ```

Don't promote when the list is part of the detection logic
(suspicious LOLBins, KQL keywords, etc.) — those should stay
inline.

### Parser extraction

If two rules share a non-trivial KQL fragment, extract a parser:

1. Create `Content/Parsers/<Category>/<Name>.yaml` with `functionAlias`,
   `category`, and the shared query body.
2. Replace the inline copy in each rule with a call to
   `<functionAlias>` (the parser becomes a callable function).
3. Re-run dep manifest. The dep manifest will reclassify the
   reference as `functions:` (in-repo function) instead of
   inline KQL.

Don't extract trivial helpers (`| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)`).
Parser deploys add deploy-pipeline complexity.

## Discovery-unfriendly patterns to avoid

These break the dependency-discovery extractor — even if KQL is
syntactically fine:

- **String concatenation to build table names**:
  `let t = strcat("Sig", "ninLogs"); table(t)` — runtime-only.
  Discovery can't see it.
- **`dynamic([...])` indirection**: `let tables =
  dynamic(["A","B"]); tables | mv-expand t | extend r = table(t)` —
  same problem.
- **Computed function calls**: `let f = strcat("foo","_func");
  f(arg)` — discovery sees neither the function name nor the
  table.

If you need indirection, write a parser. The parser becomes a
discoverable function reference.

## Hard rules

1. **Don't change the rule's `severity`, `triggerThreshold`,
   `triggerOperator`, `queryFrequency`, `queryPeriod`, `tactics`,
   `relevantTechniques`, or `entityMappings`.** Those are
   `rule-tuner` / `rule-author` concerns. You optimise the query;
   you don't change what it does.
2. **Always re-run the dep manifest** after edits that change the
   set of tables, watchlists, or functions referenced:
   ```powershell
   ./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Generate
   ```
3. **Always run `kql-validate` mentally before pushing.** The PR
   gate parses every query via Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Language;
   syntax errors that didn't fail in the portal will still fail
   the gate.
4. **Test optimisations against real data before merging.** A
   query that's "obviously faster" can in fact be slower when the
   index doesn't cooperate. Prefer measurable improvements.
5. **Document non-obvious optimisations** in the rule's
   `description` field so future maintainers don't undo them.

## Hand-offs

- **Building a brand-new rule?** Switch to `rule-author`.
- **Adjusting threshold / severity, not the query?** Switch to
  `rule-tuner`.
- **Want the dep-manifest implications explained?** Switch to
  `repo-explorer` first.
- **Need to extract a function and the parser doesn't exist
  yet?** Stay here, but coordinate with `rule-author` for the
  parser file.
