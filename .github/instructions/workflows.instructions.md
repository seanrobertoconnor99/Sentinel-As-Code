# CI/CD workflows and pipelines

GitHub Actions workflows live under `.github/workflows/`; Azure DevOps
pipelines live under `Pipelines/`. The ADO version is the default
source of truth — GitHub workflows mirror ADO behaviour except in
the narrow documented cases covered under Hard rule 1 below.
Reference doc:
[`Docs/Pipelines/README.md`](../../Docs/Pipelines/README.md).

## File inventory

| GitHub Actions | Azure DevOps | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/sentinel-deploy.yml` | `Pipelines/Sentinel-Deploy.yml` | Weekly Mon 04:00 UTC: full deploy (Bicep + Content Hub + custom + Defender) |
| `.github/workflows/sentinel-drift-detect.yml` | `Pipelines/Sentinel-Drift-Detect.yml` | Daily 06:00 UTC: detect portal-edited rules + auto-PR |
| `.github/workflows/sentinel-dcr-inventory.yml` | `Pipelines/Sentinel-DCR-Inventory.yml` | On change: deploy DCR inventory runbook |
| `.github/workflows/sentinel-dependency-update.yml` | `Pipelines/Sentinel-Dependency-Update.yml` | Daily 02:00 UTC: refresh `dependencies.json` + auto-PR |
| `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` | `Pipelines/Sentinel-PR-Validation.yml` | On every PR: 5-job merge gate |
| `.github/workflows/pr-template-validation.yml` | *(GitHub-only)* | On every PR: fail if the PR description does not fill in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` |
| `.github/workflows/sentinel-deploy-nightly.yml` | *(GitHub-only)* | Daily 03:00 UTC: E2E smoke test against test workspace |

## Composite actions

Two composite actions live under `.github/actions/`. **Use these**
instead of inlining `Azure/login@v2` or `Install-Module` patterns:

- **`./.github/actions/azure-login-oidc`** — OIDC federated login.
  Inputs: `client-id`, `tenant-id`, `subscription-id`,
  `enable-azps-session` (default `'true'`).
- **`./.github/actions/setup-pwsh-modules`** — cached + pinned
  install of Pester + powershell-yaml. Inputs: `pester-version`,
  `yaml-version`, `install-pester` (set `'false'` for yaml-only jobs
  like the dep-manifest gate).

## Hard rules

1. **ADO is the default source of truth.** When the two diverge,
   change ADO first, then port to GitHub. The reverse direction
   creates merge conflicts that are hard to spot in review.

   **Documented divergence is allowed** in the narrow cases below.
   Where it exists, justify it inline (workflow comment, commit
   message, or PR description) and reference the forcing constraint
   so future readers don't mistake the divergence for drift:

   - **Platform-forced divergence.** A constraint that exists on
     one platform but not the other forces a different shape. The
     canonical example is GitHub's 25-input `workflow_dispatch`
     cap (ADO has no equivalent limit), which is why
     `sentinel-deploy.yml` exposes a single
     `skip_custom_content_types` comma-separated string where
     `Pipelines/Sentinel-Deploy.yml` exposes nine separate boolean
     parameters. BusyBox vs GNU shell utilities in container
     images, GitHub-only `gh issue create` patterns in nightly
     workflows, and similar one-sided platform behaviours qualify.

   - **One-direction-first bug fixes.** When a bug affects both
     platforms but the fix lands on one first (typically because
     the maintainer hit the bug there first), this is acceptable
     short-term but the divergence is not the end state. Track the
     pending port as a follow-up issue or a TODO in the PR
     description so it doesn't become permanent by neglect.

   Drift caught in code review without a documented reason should
   be reverted, not retroactively justified.
2. **Pin versions for every PSGallery / NuGet / GitHub Action you
   add.** Workflow-level env vars (`PESTER_VERSION`, `YAML_VERSION`,
   `KUSTO_LANGUAGE_VERSION`) are the convention. A breaking change
   shipped from a registry must NOT be able to silently fail a
   scheduled run on an unrelated repo change.
3. **Use `actions/checkout@v4`** (the latest pinned major). Don't
   pin to `@main` or `@master`.
4. **Auth via OIDC, not service principal secrets.** All federated
   creds use the SP set up by
   `Deploy/setup/Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1`; the workflow needs
   `permissions: id-token: write`.
5. **Schedule alignment** — daily / weekly schedules must avoid
   stepping on each other. Current alignment:
   - 02:00 UTC daily: `sentinel-dependency-update`
   - 03:00 UTC daily: `sentinel-deploy-nightly` (GH-only)
   - 04:00 UTC Monday: `sentinel-deploy`
   - 06:00 UTC daily: `sentinel-drift-detect`
6. **`concurrency: cancel-in-progress: true`** for PR-style workflows
   (re-runs invalidate the previous run's status check).
   `cancel-in-progress: false` for scheduled workflows that should
   accumulate (nightly E2E, drift sync — each run keeps its own
   context for diagnosis).
7. **`workflow_dispatch` inputs match parameters** — when a workflow
   has both a schedule trigger and a manual `workflow_dispatch`
   trigger, every dispatch input must default to the same value the
   schedule run gets implicitly.
8. **Permissions block** — declare `permissions:` explicitly on
   every job (or workflow-level). Default-permissive is the wrong
   default for any job that touches a write API.

## Path filters (ADO build-validation)

The ADO PR-validation policy currently filters on these paths:

```
Content/AnalyticalRules/*;Content/HuntingQueries/*;Modules/*;Deploy/*;Tools/*;Tests/*;dependencies.json
```

If you add a new top-level folder that should trigger PR validation
(e.g. a future `Connectors/` folder), update this filter in two
places:

- `Pipelines/Sentinel-PR-Validation.yml` — `pr.paths.include` and
  `trigger.paths.include`
- The build-validation policy in ADO (Project Settings → Repos →
  Repositories → `<repo>` → Policies → Branch policies for `main`
  → Build validation). The path filter on the policy is the
  enforcement boundary; the YAML's `pr.paths.include` is the
  *trigger* boundary.
