## Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1

One-time bootstrap script that grants the service principal all required Azure, Entra ID, and Microsoft Graph permissions needed for the pipeline to operate autonomously.

### Key Features

- **Automated Permission Grant**: Grants Contributor, User Access Administrator (ABAC-conditioned), Security Administrator (Entra ID), and CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All (Graph) roles
- **Permission Summary**: Displays full summary of permissions before requesting consent
- **User Consent**: Y/N prompt with disclaimer before applying changes
- **Selective Steps**: Skip optional Entra ID or Graph permissions with `-SkipEntraRole` and `-SkipGraphPermission` switches
- **ABAC-Conditioned UAA**: User Access Administrator is condition-restricted so the SP can only assign 5 specific roles to other identities (such as playbook managed identities): Microsoft Sentinel Responder, Microsoft Sentinel Reader, Log Analytics Reader, Logic App Contributor, and Managed Identity Operator. Note this is what the SP may hand out, not what it holds itself: the SP's own workspace read access comes from its Contributor grant, and "Microsoft Sentinel Reader" is one of the assignable roles rather than a role granted to the SP directly
- **One-Time Setup**: After running once, the pipeline is fully autonomous and requires no manual intervention

### Prerequisites

- Service Principal (app registration) already created
- The user running the script needs Owner on the target subscription and at least Privileged Role Administrator in Entra ID to grant these permissions
- Authenticated Azure context (`Connect-AzAccount`)
- `Az.Accounts`, `Az.Resources`, and `Microsoft.Graph` PowerShell modules

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SubscriptionId` | string | Yes | - | Target Azure subscription ID |
| `ServicePrincipalAppId` | string | Yes | - | Application (client) ID of the deployment service principal |
| `SkipEntraRole` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip granting the Security Administrator (Entra ID) directory role |
| `SkipGraphPermission` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip granting the CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All (Graph) permission |

Both `SubscriptionId` and `ServicePrincipalAppId` are mandatory, so every invocation must pass them (there is no `TenantId` parameter; the tenant is taken from the authenticated context).

### Usage Examples

#### Full setup (all permissions)
```powershell
.\Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" `
    -ServicePrincipalAppId "your-app-id-here"
```

#### Skip Entra ID role (UEBA/Entity Analytics enabled separately)
```powershell
.\Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" `
    -ServicePrincipalAppId "your-app-id-here" `
    -SkipEntraRole
```

#### Skip Graph permission (for environments without Defender XDR)
```powershell
.\Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" `
    -ServicePrincipalAppId "your-app-id-here" `
    -SkipGraphPermission
```

#### Skip both optional permissions
```powershell
.\Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" `
    -ServicePrincipalAppId "your-app-id-here" `
    -SkipEntraRole -SkipGraphPermission
```

### How It Works

1. **Prompt for Confirmation**: Displays a comprehensive permission summary and requests Y/N consent before proceeding
2. **Grant Contributor**: Grants subscription-level Contributor role for resource group, workspace, Bicep, and content deployment. (Contributor implies Reader at the same scope, which is what ADO needs to save a workload-identity-federation service connection — see [ADO OIDC Setup](ADO-OIDC-Setup.md) for context.)
3. **Grant UAA (ABAC-Conditioned)**: Grants User Access Administrator at subscription scope with ABAC conditions restricting assignment to 5 specific roles (Microsoft Sentinel Responder, Microsoft Sentinel Reader, Log Analytics Reader, Logic App Contributor, Managed Identity Operator)
4. **Grant Security Administrator** (optional): Grants Entra ID Security Administrator role for UEBA and Entity Analytics settings
5. **Grant Graph Permission** (optional): Grants CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All Graph application permission for Defender XDR custom detection rules
6. **Completion**: Prints confirmation that setup is complete and the pipeline is ready to run autonomously

### Known Limitations

- Solutions requiring specific permissions or prerequisites may need additional configuration
- Analytics rules referencing tables/columns not present in your environment will be skipped
- Deprecated rules are skipped by design to prevent deploying outdated content
- Some workbooks may have dependencies on specific data sources being configured

---

## Deploy-CustomContent.ps1

Deploys custom content from the repository to a Microsoft Sentinel workspace: KQL parsers (YAML), analytics rules (YAML), watchlists (JSON+CSV), playbooks (ARM templates), workbooks (gallery JSON), hunting queries (YAML), automation rules (JSON), and summary rules (JSON).

### Key Features

- **Smart Deployment**: Opt-in via `-SmartDeployment` (defaults to OFF, i.e. a full deploy). When enabled, uses git diff to detect changed files and skip unchanged content; `deployment-state.json` tracks deployment outcomes across runs to automatically retry previously failed items
- **Dependency Graph System**: Validates prerequisites per content item (tables, watchlists, functions); detections with missing dependencies deploy disabled, other content types skip
- **KQL Parser Deployment**: Deploy workspace saved searches as reusable KQL functions from YAML
- **YAML Detection Rules**: Author detections in YAML (Azure-Sentinel repo format), converted to REST API JSON at deploy time
- **Watchlist Management**: Deploy watchlists with inline CSV upload via REST API
- **Playbook Deployment**: Deploy Logic App playbooks via ARM template deployments with module-first ordering, ARM parameter auto-injection, optional separate resource group, template folder exclusion, and 64-character name truncation
- **Workbook Deployment**: Deploy workbooks with stable GUIDs for idempotent updates; accepts both raw gallery/notebook template JSON and ARM deployment templates that wrap a `Microsoft.Insights/workbooks` resource (the inner `serializedData` is extracted automatically)
- **Hunting Query Deployment**: Deploy YAML-based saved searches to the workspace
- **Automation Rule Deployment**: Deploy JSON automation rules for incident auto-response
- **Summary Rule Deployment**: Deploy JSON summary rules to aggregate verbose logs into cost-effective custom tables via the Log Analytics API
- **Selective Deployment**: Skip individual content types with `-Skip*` switches
- **Dry Run Mode**: `WhatIf` parameter previews all changes without applying
- **ADO Pipeline Integration**: Emits pipeline warnings, section messages, and structured output
- **Azure Government Support**: Targets Azure Government cloud with the `-IsGov` switch

### Prerequisites

- `Az.Accounts` PowerShell module
- `powershell-yaml` module (for YAML detection parsing)
- Authenticated Azure context (`Connect-AzAccount` or Azure DevOps service connection)

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SubscriptionId` | string | No | Current context | Azure Subscription ID |
| `ResourceGroup` | string | Yes | - | Resource Group containing the Sentinel workspace |
| `PlaybookResourceGroup` | string | No | Same as `ResourceGroup` | Resource Group for playbook (Logic App) deployments |
| `Workspace` | string | Yes | - | Log Analytics workspace name |
| `Region` | string | Yes | - | Azure region (e.g., `uksouth`, `eastus`) |
| `BasePath` | string | No | `$env:BUILD_SOURCESDIRECTORY` or `.` | Repo root path |
| `SmartDeployment` | switch | No | `$false` | Opt-in switch; when passed, uses git diff to detect changed files and skip unchanged content. Omitted (the default) means a full deploy of all content |
| `SkipParsers` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom KQL parser deployment |
| `SkipDetections` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom detection deployment |
| `SkipCommunityDetections` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip rules under `Content/AnalyticalRules/Community/**` only — non-community detections still deploy. Used by the pipeline's "Skip Community Detections" toggle |
| `SkipWatchlists` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom watchlist deployment |
| `SkipPlaybooks` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom playbook deployment |
| `SkipWorkbooks` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom workbook deployment |
| `SkipHuntingQueries` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom hunting query deployment |
| `SkipAutomationRules` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom automation rule deployment |
| `SkipSummaryRules` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip custom summary rule deployment |
| `IsGov` | switch | No | `$false` | Target Azure Government cloud |
| `WhatIf` | switch | No | `$false` | Dry run (no changes applied) |

### Usage Examples

#### Deploy All Custom Content
```powershell
.\Deploy-CustomContent.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -Workspace "law-sentinel-prod" `
    -Region "uksouth"
```

#### Deploy Only Detections and Watchlists
```powershell
.\Deploy-CustomContent.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -Workspace "law-sentinel-prod" `
    -Region "uksouth" `
    -SkipPlaybooks `
    -SkipWorkbooks
```

#### Deploy Only Hunting Queries and Automation Rules
```powershell
.\Deploy-CustomContent.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -Workspace "law-sentinel-prod" `
    -Region "uksouth" `
    -SkipDetections `
    -SkipWatchlists `
    -SkipPlaybooks `
    -SkipWorkbooks
```

#### Deploy Playbooks to a Separate Resource Group
```powershell
.\Deploy-CustomContent.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -PlaybookResourceGroup "rg-playbooks-prod" `
    -Workspace "law-sentinel-prod" `
    -Region "uksouth"
```

#### Dry Run
```powershell
.\Deploy-CustomContent.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -Workspace "law-sentinel-prod" `
    -Region "uksouth" `
    -WhatIf
```

### How It Works

1. **Authentication and Setup**: Validates Azure context, resolves subscription ID, and configures API endpoints
2. **Smart Deployment Check**: Smart deployment is off unless `-SmartDeployment` is passed; the default is a full deploy of every content type (the log records "Smart deployment disabled, all content will be deployed"). When enabled, uses git diff to detect changed files; unchanged files are skipped unless they were not previously deployed successfully (tracked in `deployment-state.json`). Failed items are automatically retried on subsequent runs. The smart-deployment skip applies to every content type, not just detections
3. **Dependency Graph Validation**: Loads `dependencies.json` and performs pre-flight checks to bulk-fetch workspace state (tables, watchlists, functions); runs `Test-ContentDependencies` before each content type
4. **Parser Deployment** (Stage 1): Scans `Content/Parsers/` for YAML files, validates required fields including `functionAlias`, converts to saved search body, and deploys via `PUT` to the `savedSearches` endpoint
5. **Watchlist Deployment** (Stage 2): Scans `Content/Watchlists/` for subdirectories with `watchlist.json` + `data.csv`, validates metadata, and deploys via `PUT` with inline CSV content
6. **Detection Deployment** (Stage 3): Scans `Content/AnalyticalRules/` for YAML files, validates required fields, converts to REST API JSON; if dependencies are missing, deploys as disabled (not skipped) — if API rejects disabled state, gracefully skipped
7. **Hunting Query Deployment** (Stage 4): Scans `Content/HuntingQueries/` for YAML files, validates required fields, builds saved search body with tactics/techniques tags, and deploys via `PUT` to the `savedSearches` endpoint
8. **Playbook Deployment** (Stage 5): Scans `Content/Playbooks/` for subdirectories with `azuredeploy.json` (excludes `Template/` directory), orders Module/ playbooks first with leaf modules deployed before dependent modules, auto-injects known ARM parameters (ResourceGroup, Workspace, SubscriptionId, WorkspaceId, PlaybookResourceGroup), truncates names to 64 characters, and deploys via `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment` to the playbook resource group (uses `Test-AzResourceGroupDeployment` for WhatIf)
9. **Workbook Deployment** (Stage 6): Scans `Content/Workbooks/` for subdirectories with `workbook.json`, reads optional `metadata.json` for stable GUIDs, and deploys via `PUT` to the `Microsoft.Insights/workbooks` endpoint. The `workbook.json` may be either the raw gallery/notebook template JSON, or an ARM deployment template that wraps a `Microsoft.Insights/workbooks` resource (for example `UnifiNetworkOverview`); the deployer detects the ARM shape (a `$schema` matching a deployment template) and extracts the inner workbook `serializedData` before the PUT, so both formats deploy correctly
10. **Automation Rule Deployment** (Stage 7): Scans `Content/AutomationRules/` for JSON files, validates required fields (automationRuleId, displayName, order, triggeringLogic, actions), and deploys via `PUT` to the `automationRules` endpoint
11. **Summary Rule Deployment** (Stage 8): Scans `Content/SummaryRules/` for JSON files, validates required fields (name, query, binSize, destinationTable), validates binSize against allowed values and `_CL` suffix, and deploys via `PUT` to the `summarylogs` endpoint using the `Microsoft.OperationalInsights` provider
12. **Status Reporting**: Prints a summary table with deployed/skipped/failed counts per content type

### Content Folder Structure and Deployment Order

Content deploys in the following order (also driven by `dependencies.json`):

1. **Parsers** — KQL parser/function definitions
2. **Watchlists** — Reusable data lists
3. **Detections** — Analytics rules
4. **Hunting Queries** — Saved searches
5. **Playbooks** — Logic App automation
6. **Workbooks** — Visualisation dashboards
7. **Automation Rules** — Incident auto-response
8. **Summary Rules** — Cost-optimised aggregation

Schema details for each content type:
- [Analytical-Rules.md](../Content/Analytical-Rules.md) — YAML analytics rule schema
- [Watchlists.md](../Content/Watchlists.md) — Watchlist metadata and CSV format
- [Playbooks.md](../Content/Playbooks.md) — ARM template requirements

## Deploy-DefenderDetections.ps1

Deploys custom detection rules to Microsoft Defender XDR via the Microsoft Graph Security API (beta). Rules are authored as YAML files in the `Content/DefenderCustomDetections/` folder and use the Advanced Hunting KQL schema.

### Key Features

- **Graph Security API**: Deploys rules via `POST`/`PATCH` to `/beta/security/rules/detectionRules`
- **Upsert Logic**: Creates new rules or updates existing ones matched by `displayName`
- **Response Actions**: Supports all Defender response actions (isolate device, force password reset, soft-delete email, etc.)
- **Pagination Handling**: Fetches all existing rules with OData pagination
- **Dry Run Mode**: `WhatIf` parameter previews all changes without applying
- **ADO Pipeline Integration**: Emits pipeline warnings, section messages, and structured output
- **Azure Government Support**: Targets Azure Government Graph endpoint with the `-IsGov` switch

### Prerequisites

- `Az.Accounts` PowerShell module
- `powershell-yaml` module (for YAML parsing)
- Authenticated Azure context with `CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All` Graph application permission
- Admin consent granted for the Graph permission

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BasePath` | string | No | Repo root (two levels above `Deploy/content/`) | Repo root path containing `Content/DefenderCustomDetections/` |
| `IsGov` | switch | No | `$false` | Target Azure Government cloud (`graph.microsoft.us`) |
| `WhatIf` | switch | No | `$false` | Dry run (no changes applied) |

### Usage Examples

#### Deploy All Defender Detections
```powershell
.\Deploy-DefenderDetections.ps1
```

#### Deploy from a Specific Path
```powershell
.\Deploy-DefenderDetections.ps1 -BasePath "C:\Repos\Sentinel-As-Code"
```

#### Dry Run
```powershell
.\Deploy-DefenderDetections.ps1 -WhatIf
```

### How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Acquires a Microsoft Graph token via `Get-AzAccessToken -ResourceUrl "https://graph.microsoft.com"` using the existing Azure context
2. **Fetch Existing Rules**: Queries the Graph API to list all current custom detection rules for upsert matching by `displayName`
3. **YAML Processing**: Scans `Content/DefenderCustomDetections/` for YAML files, validates required fields (`displayName`, `queryCondition.queryText`, `schedule.period`, `detectionAction.alertTemplate`)
4. **Upsert**: If a rule with the same `displayName` exists, updates it via `PATCH`; otherwise creates via `POST`
5. **Status Reporting**: Prints a summary with created/updated/skipped/failed counts

### Content Folder Structure

See [Defender-Custom-Detections.md](../Content/Defender-Custom-Detections.md) for the full YAML schema, response action types, and impacted asset identifiers.

## Import-CommunityRules.ps1

Imports community analytical rules from external repositories into the local codebase. Currently supports the David Alonso (Dalonso) Security repository. See [Community-Rules.md](../Content/Community-Rules.md) for the full contribution model.

### Key Features

- **External Repository Support**: Currently supports David Alonso's Threat Hunting rules (111 published rules)
- **YAML Rule Import**: Clones external Git repositories and copies YAML-format detection rules
- **Format Conversion**: Optionally converts KQL+ARM hybrid rules to YAML format for consistency
- **Attribution Tracking**: Automatically adds source attribution and creation metadata to imported rules
- **Disabled by Default**: All imported rules deploy with `enabled: false` for review before activation
- **Manifest Generation**: Creates `import-manifest.json` (next to the rules) with content hashes for upstream-drift detection
- **Auto-Generated Summary**: Writes a Markdown summary to `Docs/Content/Community/{ContributorName}.md` with rule counts and per-category listings
- **Change Detection**: Uses SHA-256 checksums to track which rules have changed between runs; only updates modified content
- **Idempotent**: Fully re-runnable — unchanged rules are skipped, failed rules are retried on next execution
- **Dry Run Mode**: `DryRun` parameter previews all changes without writing to disk
- **ADO Pipeline Integration**: Emits pipeline warnings and structured output

### Prerequisites

- `powershell-yaml` module (for YAML parsing and generation)
- Git command-line tools (for repository cloning)
- Internet access to external repositories

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OutputPath` | string | No | `Content/AnalyticalRules/Community/Dalonso` | Target folder for imported rule YAMLs and `import-manifest.json` |
| `DocsPath` | string | No | `Docs/Content/Community/{ContributorName}.md` (auto-derived from `OutputPath` leaf) | Destination for the auto-generated Markdown summary |
| `SourceRepo` | string | No | `https://github.com/davidalonsod/Dalonso-Security-Repo.git` | Git URL of source repository |
| `SourceBranch` | string | No | `main` | Branch name to clone from |
| `IncludeKqlConversion` | switch | No | `$false` | Also convert KQL+ARM rules to YAML format |
| `DryRun` | switch | No | `$false` | Preview changes without writing files |

### Usage Examples

#### Import Default Community Rules
```powershell
.\Import-CommunityRules.ps1
```

#### Import with KQL Conversion
```powershell
.\Import-CommunityRules.ps1 -IncludeKqlConversion
```

#### Dry Run Preview
```powershell
.\Import-CommunityRules.ps1 -DryRun
```

#### Onboard a New Contributor
```powershell
.\Import-CommunityRules.ps1 `
    -OutputPath ./Content/AnalyticalRules/Community/NewContributor `
    -DocsPath   ./Docs/Content/Community/NewContributor.md `
    -SourceRepo "https://github.com/example/threat-rules.git"
```

### How It Works

1. **Repository Cloning**: Clones the source repository to a temporary directory using the specified branch
2. **Rule Discovery**: Scans the cloned repository for YAML-format detection rules
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Reads rule metadata (title, description, tactics, techniques, severity)
4. **Format Conversion** (optional): If `-IncludeKqlConversion` is enabled, converts KQL+ARM hybrid rules to YAML
5. **Attribution**: Adds source repository attribution and original author information to each rule
6. **Deployment State**: Sets `enabled: false` on all imported rules for review before activation
7. **Change Detection**: Compares SHA-256 checksums of each rule against the `import-manifest.json` manifest to detect changes
8. **File Writing**: Writes new and updated rules to `OutputPath`, skips unchanged rules
9. **Manifest Creation**: Updates `import-manifest.json` with metadata for all imported rules including source, rule count, and import timestamp
10. **Summary Generation**: Writes the human-readable summary to `DocsPath` (under `Docs/Content/Community/`) with import source, total rule count, organisation, and instructions for enabling rules
11. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary clone directory

### Import State Tracking

The import process tracks changes using `import-manifest.json` (next to the rules):
- **First Run**: Creates initial manifest; imports all rules
- **Subsequent Runs**: Compares content hashes; only updates changed rules
- **Retries**: Previously failed rules are flagged for retry on next execution
- **Idempotency**: Running multiple times produces the same result with no duplicate imports

### Content Folder Structure

Imported community rules are organised by source:

```
Content/AnalyticalRules/Community/
└── Dalonso/
    ├── *.yaml                    # Imported community detection rules (per category subfolder)
    └── import-manifest.json      # Content-hash manifest

Docs/Content/Community/
└── Dalonso.md                    # Auto-generated summary, governance doc lives at Docs/Content/Community-Rules.md
```

Each imported rule includes:
- Original rule title and description
- Tactics and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Severity level
- Source repository attribution
- Original author information (where available)
- `enabled: false` flag for review

---

## Set-PlaybookPermissions.ps1

Post-deployment RBAC bootstrap for Logic App playbooks. After
`Deploy-CustomContent.ps1` deploys playbooks (each tagged
`Source: Sentinel-As-Code`), this script scans them, determines what
permissions each playbook actually needs based on its workflow content,
and assigns the minimum required roles to each Logic App's
system-assigned managed identity.

### Why this script exists

`Deploy-CustomContent.ps1` runs as the deployment service principal,
which has `Contributor` on the resource group plus an ABAC-conditioned
`User Access Administrator` role (set up by `Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1`).
That ABAC condition is intentionally restrictive — the deployer can only
assign a fixed set of low-privilege roles. It cannot, for example,
grant `Microsoft Sentinel Contributor` directly on the workspace.

The role-assignment work is therefore split out:
- **`Deploy-CustomContent.ps1`** deploys the Logic App ARM templates
  (the playbook resource itself), enables system-assigned managed
  identity, and tags it with `Source: Sentinel-As-Code`.
- **`Set-PlaybookPermissions.ps1`** runs separately as a higher-privilege
  identity (User Access Administrator or Owner) and grants the playbook
  MSIs the roles they need to actually function.

### Key features

- **Tag-scoped discovery** — only Logic Apps with the `Source: Sentinel-As-Code` tag are considered, so hand-deployed Logic Apps in the same resource group are left alone.
- **Workflow-content analysis** — instead of granting every role to every playbook, the script inspects each workflow's JSON to derive the minimum role set:
  - **API connectors** (`azuresentinel`, `keyvault`, `wdatp`, `azuremonitorlogs`, `microsoftgraphsecurity`, etc.) → mapped to specific roles per connector type.
  - **HTTP actions using ManagedServiceIdentity** — when a playbook calls Graph, Defender, or Log Analytics REST APIs directly via the HTTP action with `authentication.type: ManagedServiceIdentity`, the script reads the URL prefix to grant the right role for that endpoint.
  - **Sentinel-specific actions** — actions that modify incidents, watchlists, or comments require Sentinel-Contributor-tier roles even when the connector is generic.
- **Idempotent** — re-runs are safe; existing assignments are detected and skipped.
- **WhatIf mode** — preview every assignment before applying.

### Parameter reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SubscriptionId` | string | No | Current Az context | Azure subscription containing the Logic Apps |
| `PlaybookResourceGroup` | string | Yes | - | Resource group where Logic App playbooks are deployed |
| `SentinelResourceGroup` | string | No | Same as `PlaybookResourceGroup` | Resource group containing the Sentinel workspace, if different |
| `SentinelWorkspaceName` | string | Yes | - | Log Analytics workspace name (used to scope Sentinel role assignments) |
| `KeyVaultName` | string | No | - | Key Vault used by playbooks. Required only when at least one playbook references Key Vault |
| `WhatIf` | switch | No | `$false` | Preview role assignments without applying |

### Usage

```powershell
# Standard run — Sentinel + playbooks in the same resource group
./Set-PlaybookPermissions.ps1 `
    -PlaybookResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -SentinelWorkspaceName "law-sentinel-prod"

# Sentinel and playbooks in separate resource groups, Key Vault in use
./Set-PlaybookPermissions.ps1 `
    -PlaybookResourceGroup "rg-playbooks-prod" `
    -SentinelResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -SentinelWorkspaceName "law-sentinel-prod" `
    -KeyVaultName "kv-sentinel-prod"

# Dry run
./Set-PlaybookPermissions.ps1 `
    -PlaybookResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -SentinelWorkspaceName "law-sentinel-prod" `
    -WhatIf
```

### Prerequisites for the executing principal

The identity running this script needs **`User Access Administrator`** or
**`Owner`** on the playbook resource group (and on the Sentinel resource
group if different). The deployment SPN does not have this role by
default — `Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1` only grants it under an ABAC
condition that doesn't permit Sentinel-tier role assignments. Run this
script under a separate elevated identity (typically a one-off run by
an admin user, not the pipeline SPN).

---

## Set-RunbookPermissions.ps1

Post-deployment RBAC bootstrap for the DCR-watchlist Automation Account.
It is the Automation-runbook sibling of `Set-PlaybookPermissions.ps1`:
after the `Infra/dcr-watchlist/` stack deploys the Automation Account and
its system-assigned managed identity, this script grants that identity
the two roles the sync runbook ([`Invoke-DCRWatchlistSync.ps1`](#invoke-dcrwatchlistsyncps1))
needs to operate.

### Why this script exists

The pipeline service principal does not hold
`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`, so it cannot assign
these roles itself. RBAC for the Automation Account managed identity is
therefore applied out of band by a user with Owner or User Access
Administrator on the subscription. Run it once after the DCR-watchlist
infrastructure is first deployed.

### Roles granted

- **Monitoring Reader** (subscription scope) - lets the runbook list
  Data Collection Rules and their associations via the ARM API.
- **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** (Sentinel resource group scope) -
  lets the runbook create and update the Sentinel watchlist.

### Parameter reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SubscriptionId` | string | Yes | - | Target subscription ID |
| `AutomationAccountName` | string | Yes | - | Name of the DCR-watchlist Automation Account (conventionally `aa-dcr-watchlist-sync`) |
| `AutomationResourceGroup` | string | Yes | - | Resource group containing the Automation Account (conventionally `rg-dcr-watchlist-sync`) |
| `SentinelResourceGroup` | string | Yes | - | Resource group containing the Sentinel workspace (scope for the Sentinel Contributor grant) |
| `Remove` | switch | No | `$false` | Remove the role assignments instead of creating them |

The script uses `[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]`, so `-WhatIf`
previews every assignment before applying.

### Usage

```powershell
# Apply permissions
.\Set-RunbookPermissions.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" `
    -AutomationAccountName "aa-dcr-watchlist-sync" `
    -AutomationResourceGroup "rg-dcr-watchlist-sync" `
    -SentinelResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod"

# Remove permissions
.\Set-RunbookPermissions.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" `
    -AutomationAccountName "aa-dcr-watchlist-sync" `
    -AutomationResourceGroup "rg-dcr-watchlist-sync" `
    -SentinelResourceGroup "rg-sentinel-prod" `
    -Remove
```

### Prerequisites for the executing principal

Owner or User Access Administrator on the subscription. As with
`Set-PlaybookPermissions.ps1`, the deployment SPN cannot run this because
it lacks role-assignment write.

## Build-DependencyManifest.ps1

Walks `Content/AnalyticalRules/` and `Content/HuntingQueries/`, parses every embedded
KQL query, and emits or verifies `dependencies.json` — the manifest the
deploy pipeline reads to drive content-ordering decisions. Replaces the
previously hand-maintained workflow.

See [Operations / Dependency Manifest](../Tools/Dependency-Manifest.md)
for the full discovery model, schema, and reasoning. This section
covers the script's parameter surface and operating modes.

### Key features

- **Three operating modes** — Generate (write the manifest from
  discovery), Verify (drift-check vs the on-disk manifest, used by
  the PR-validation gate), Update (drift-detect + write to disk for
  the daily auto-PR workflow).
- **Repo-driven inventory** — no hard-coded table list. Functions
  come from `Content/Parsers/**/*.yaml`, watchlists from
  `Content/Watchlists/*/watchlist.json`, playbooks from `Content/Playbooks/**/*.json`.
  Tables default to "anything not classified as a function" because
  tables are external (data plane) and not deployable from the repo.
- **KQL pattern coverage** — extracts identifiers from start of
  statement, after `let X =`, after `union`, inside `join` / `lookup`
  / `materialize` / `view` / `toscalar` subqueries, and from
  `table('X')` string-arg patterns (lambda-wrapper invocations).
- **Watchlist cross-validation** — flags `_GetWatchlist('alias')`
  references that don't resolve to an in-repo watchlist as warnings.
- **Offline** — no Azure auth required; reads YAML and JSON only.

### Parameter reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Mode` | string (`Generate` \| `Verify` \| `Update`) | Yes | - | Operating mode (see below) |
| `RepoPath` | string | No | Parent of the script folder (Deploy/ or Tools/) | Repository root |
| `ManifestPath` | string | No | `<RepoPath>/dependencies.json` | Manifest file path |

### Operating modes

#### Generate

Walks content, builds the manifest, writes `dependencies.json`. Authors
run this locally after editing rules and commit the regenerated file
alongside the rule changes.

```powershell
./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Generate
```

#### Verify

Builds the manifest in-memory and compares against the on-disk file.
Exits 0 on match, 1 on drift with a structured diff. Used by:

- The PR-validation `dependency-manifest` job
  ([`.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml))
  and its ADO equivalent
  ([`Pipelines/Sentinel-PR-Validation.yml`](../../Pipelines/Sentinel-PR-Validation.yml)).
- The pre-deploy guard at the start of the Deploy Custom Content stage
  in both [`sentinel-deploy.yml`](../../.github/workflows/sentinel-deploy.yml)
  and [`Sentinel-Deploy.yml`](../../Pipelines/Sentinel-Deploy.yml).

```powershell
./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Verify
# exit 0 = manifest matches; exit 1 = drift (with diff printed)
```

#### Update

Like Verify, but on detected drift writes the regenerated manifest to
disk and exits 0. The calling pipeline owns the commit + branch + PR
step. Used by the daily auto-PR workflow
([`sentinel-dependency-update.yml`](../../.github/workflows/sentinel-dependency-update.yml)
and its ADO equivalent).

```powershell
./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Update
```

### Author workflow

After editing or adding a rule that references new tables, watchlists,
or functions:

```powershell
./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Generate
git add dependencies.json
git commit
```

If you forget, the PR-validation gate fails with a clear "out of sync"
error and the regenerate command. If you forget AND the gate's path
filter misses the change (rare — happens for doc-only commits that
adjust an inline query), the daily workflow opens a chore PR within
24 hours.

### Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7.2+
- `powershell-yaml` module (auto-installed by the script if missing)
- `Modules/Sentinel.Common` (auto-imported from the script — provides
  `Get-ContentDependencies` and the KQL extractors)

## Authoring with GitHub Copilot

When editing files under `Deploy/**`, `Tools/**`, or `Modules/**`, Copilot
automatically loads
[`.github/instructions/powershell-scripts.instructions.md`](../../.github/instructions/powershell-scripts.instructions.md).
The path-scoped instructions cover the file-header convention,
`Sentinel.Common` import patterns, and the foot-gun list
(`[void]` Boolean leak, single-element array indexing, strict-mode
property access, `$script:` scope rules).

Copilot tooling for scripts and modules:

- Agent `Sentinel-As-Code: PowerShell Engineer` — owns
  `Modules/Sentinel.Common` end-to-end. Add functions, refactor
  scripts, modernise legacy patterns, harden against strict-mode
  failures. Knows the module-manifest discipline (version bump +
  ReleaseNotes + Pester tests in lockstep).
- Agent `Sentinel-As-Code: Dependencies Engineer` — when a change
  touches the discovery extractors (`Get-KqlBareIdentifiers`,
  `Get-ContentDependencies`, etc.).
- Agent `Sentinel-As-Code: Security Reviewer` — for review of
  secret-handling, log-leak surface, RBAC-impacting scripts.
- Slash command `/regenerate-deps` (VS Code) — runs
  `Build-DependencyManifest -Mode Generate`.

## Export-SentinelWorkbooks.ps1

Exports every Sentinel workbook in a workspace into the
`Content/Workbooks/<FolderName>/` shape that
[`Deploy-CustomContent.ps1`](../../Deploy/content/Deploy-CustomContent.ps1)'s
`Deploy-CustomWorkbooks` function redeploys from. The exported tree
is byte-compatible with what the deployer reads — round-trip
(export → commit → redeploy) lands updates on the same Azure
resource rather than spawning duplicates.

### Key features

- **Bulk export** — lists every Sentinel-scoped workbook in one
  REST call (`Microsoft.Insights/workbooks` filtered by
  `category=sentinel` and `sourceId={workspaceResourceId}`).
- **Content Hub workbooks excluded by default** — only Custom
  workbooks land in the repo. The script enumerates the
  workspace's `Microsoft.SecurityInsights/metadata` resources to
  identify which workbooks were installed by a Content Hub
  solution (via `source.kind == 'Solution'`), and skips them.
  Override with `-IncludeContentHub` if you have a specific reason
  (e.g. forking a solution-provided workbook into your own
  governance — rare).
- **Folder name = PascalCase compaction of `displayName`** — the
  on-disk folder is the workbook's displayName with non-alphanumeric
  runs (spaces, punctuation, parens) treated as word boundaries
  and each word TitleCased. All-upper acronyms become TitleCase
  (`GBP` → `Gbp`); user-curated camelCase brands (e.g. `pfSense`)
  are preserved. This matches the existing `Content/Workbooks/*` convention
  in the repo (e.g. `MicrosoftSentinelCostGbp`,
  `MicrosoftSentinelMonitoring`).
- **Workspace-name suffix stripped** — Microsoft-published
  workbook templates that get instantiated per-workspace pick up
  a ` - <workspace-name>` suffix on their displayName (e.g.
  `Data Collection Rule Toolkit - stl-eus-siem-law`). The script
  strips this suffix before deriving the folder name AND from
  the metadata.json's displayName. Sentinel re-attaches it at
  display time on redeploy, so the round-trip stays stable.
- **Workspace ARM ID stripped from workbook content** — Sentinel
  bakes the source workspace's full ARM resource ID into
  `fallbackResourceIds` and sometimes inline resource references
  (e.g. `/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/<ws>`).
  The script replaces every case-insensitive occurrence with the
  placeholder convention used by hand-curated repo workbooks
  (`/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourcegroups/your-resource-group/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/your-workspace`),
  so the workbook isn't pinned to one specific workspace. The
  field only affects standalone Workbooks-portal viewing; opening
  the workbook from within a Sentinel workspace uses the
  workspace context regardless.
- **Workbook GUID preservation** — writes the workbook's resource
  GUID into `metadata.json` as `workbookId`. The next deploy
  reads it back and hits the same Azure resource, avoiding the
  duplicate-workbook failure mode.
- **`-OnlyMissing` mode** — skip workbooks that already have a
  folder. Useful for incremental import without overwriting
  in-repo customisations.
- **`-Filter` regex** — narrow the export to a subset by
  `displayName` match.
- **`-WhatIf` mode** — read everything, write nothing.
- **Azure Government Support** — `-IsGov` switch.
- **Existing-metadata preservation** — extra keys in an existing
  `metadata.json` (tags, custom annotations) survive overwrite;
  only the keys this script writes are replaced.

### Parameter reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SubscriptionId` | string | No | Current Az context | Azure Subscription ID |
| `ResourceGroup` | string | Yes | - | Resource group containing the Sentinel workspace |
| `Workspace` | string | Yes | - | Log Analytics workspace name (used to derive `WorkspaceResourceId` for the `sourceId` filter) |
| `Region` | string | Yes | - | Azure region (passed through to `Connect-AzureEnvironment`) |
| `BasePath` | string | No | Parent of the script folder (Deploy/ or Tools/) | Repo root path; output is written to `<BasePath>/Content/Workbooks/` |
| `Filter` | string | No | `'.'` | Regex applied to each workbook's `displayName`; non-matching workbooks skipped |
| `OnlyMissing` | switch | No | `$false` | Skip workbooks that already have a folder under `Content/Workbooks/` |
| `IncludeContentHub` | switch | No | `$false` | By default, Content Hub-managed workbooks are excluded. Pass to include them (advanced; usually wrong because Content Hub will overwrite on update) |
| `WhatIf` | switch | No | `$false` | Preview without writing |
| `IsGov` | switch | No | `$false` | Target Azure Government cloud |

### Usage examples

#### Export every workbook in the workspace

```powershell
.\Export-SentinelWorkbooks.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup 'rg-sentinel-prod' `
    -Workspace     'law-sentinel-prod' `
    -Region        'uksouth'
```

#### Incremental import — only workbooks not in the repo yet

```powershell
.\Export-SentinelWorkbooks.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup 'rg-sentinel-prod' `
    -Workspace     'law-sentinel-prod' `
    -Region        'uksouth' `
    -OnlyMissing
```

#### Preview without writing

```powershell
.\Export-SentinelWorkbooks.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup 'rg-sentinel-prod' `
    -Workspace     'law-sentinel-prod' `
    -Region        'uksouth' `
    -WhatIf
```

#### Export only workbooks whose display name starts with 'Identity'

```powershell
.\Export-SentinelWorkbooks.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroup 'rg-sentinel-prod' `
    -Workspace     'law-sentinel-prod' `
    -Region        'uksouth' `
    -Filter        '^Identity'
```

### How it works

1. **Authentication and Setup**: Imports the `Sentinel.Common`
   module and calls `Connect-AzureEnvironment` to acquire an
   access token + workspace resource ID.
2. **Identify Content Hub workbooks**: Unless `-IncludeContentHub`
   was supplied, the script first calls
   `GET .../providers/Microsoft.SecurityInsights/metadata?api-version=2025-09-01`
   (with pagination) and builds a HashSet of workbook resource IDs
   where `properties.kind == 'Workbook'` AND
   `properties.source.kind == 'Solution'`. Any workbook found in
   this set is skipped during the export pass.
3. **List**: Calls
   `GET /subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/workbooks?api-version=2022-04-01&category=sentinel&sourceId={workspaceResourceId}&canFetchContent=true`
   to enumerate Sentinel workbooks. **`canFetchContent=true` is
   essential** — without it the LIST API returns only resource
   metadata, omitting the `serializedData` (the gallery template
   content) to keep response sizes small. The flag tells ARM to
   include full content for workbooks the caller has read access to.
4. **Per-workbook GET fallback**: If a workbook's content is still
   absent from the LIST response (rare — typically a Microsoft-
   published Content Hub workbook the workspace inherits, which
   the metadata-based filter in step 2 should have already
   excluded), the script does a per-resource
   `GET /subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/workbooks/{name}?canFetchContent=true`
   to resolve content one workbook at a time. Only workbooks where
   neither the list nor the detail fetch returns content get
   skipped (with a clear warning explaining the cause).
5. **Per-workbook export**: For each result:
   - Skip if the workbook ID is in the Content Hub set (unless
     `-IncludeContentHub` was supplied)
   - Filter by regex on `displayName` if `-Filter` was supplied
   - Strip any trailing ` - <WorkspaceName>` suffix from the
     displayName (Microsoft attaches this to workspace-instantiated
     templates; not useful for repo storage)
   - Skip if `-OnlyMissing` and the folder already exists
   - Reformat `serializedData` (a JSON string) via
     `ConvertFrom-Json` + `ConvertTo-Json -Depth 32` so the
     on-disk file is pretty-printed
   - Replace every occurrence of the source workspace's ARM
     resource ID in the JSON with the placeholder
     `/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/...`
     (case-insensitive) so the workbook isn't pinned to one
     workspace
   - Write `Content/Workbooks/<FolderName>/workbook.json` and
     `Content/Workbooks/<FolderName>/metadata.json` (using the cleaned
     displayName for both folder name and metadata.json)
6. **Status reporting**: Prints a summary table with exported /
   skipped / failed counts.

### Symmetry contract with `Deploy-CustomWorkbooks`

| Concern | Export side | Deploy side |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API version | `2022-04-01` | `2022-04-01` |
| Folder name | PascalCase compaction of `displayName` (with workspace suffix stripped) | Folder name walked as-is; deploy reads `displayName` from `metadata.json` |
| `workbook.json` content | The full gallery template | Read into `serializedData` of the deploy body |
| `metadata.json` keys read | `displayName`, `description`, `category`, `sourceId`, `workbookId` | Same keys consumed |
| Resource GUID | Preserved via `workbookId` | Used as the URI's `{workbookId}` segment |

### Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7.2+
- `Az.Accounts` (auto-imported by `Sentinel.Common`)
- Authenticated Azure context (`Connect-AzAccount` or service-principal context)
- The deploy SP needs at least **Microsoft Sentinel Reader** on the workspace to list workbooks. The standard `Setup-ServicePrincipal.ps1` Contributor grant covers this.

### Known limitations

- Only workbooks where `category == sentinel` are exported. Application Insights / general-purpose workbooks living under the same workspace are filtered out by design.
- Content Hub-managed workbooks are excluded by default (see step 2 of How it works). If the workspace has many Content Hub solutions installed, you may see a long list of "Skipping ... — Content Hub-managed workbook" messages. This is intentional; pass `-IncludeContentHub` only if you have a specific reason.
- Templates that haven't been customised in the workspace don't appear at all — they're served from the Content Hub catalogue, not the workspace's resource list, so there's nothing to export.

## Invoke-DCRWatchlistSync.ps1

Rebuilds the Sentinel "Customer DCR Resources" watchlist from the live
inventory of Data Collection Rules and their associations. This is the
runbook that runs on the schedule set up by the `Infra/dcr-watchlist/`
stack (Automation Account plus runbook), authenticating as the Automation
Account's system-assigned managed identity. `Set-RunbookPermissions.ps1`
grants that identity the roles this script needs.

### What it does

1. Authenticates via the system-assigned managed identity.
2. Lists every Data Collection Rule in the subscription with
   `Invoke-AzRestMethod` (DCR api-version `2024-03-11`) and retrieves the
   associations for each DCR. There is no `Az.ResourceGraph` dependency;
   it uses the same ARM REST pattern as `Invoke-DCRAudit.ps1`.
3. Builds an in-memory CSV (one row per DCR).
4. Calls the Sentinel watchlist REST API (api-version `2025-09-01`) to
   delete and recreate the watchlist in a single full-replace operation.

Because there is one row per DCR, the watchlist's search key is
`DCRName` (the script's default). The DCR-inventory pipelines register
the runbook with `SearchKey=DCRName` to match the per-DCR rows.

### Parameter reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SubscriptionId` | string | Yes | - | Subscription to enumerate DCRs from |
| `WorkspaceResourceGroup` | string | Yes | - | Resource group containing the Sentinel Log Analytics workspace |
| `WorkspaceName` | string | Yes | - | Log Analytics workspace name (Sentinel) |
| `WatchlistAlias` | string | Yes | - | Alias (unique identifier) for the Sentinel watchlist |
| `WatchlistDisplayName` | string | No | `Customer DCR Resources` | Human-readable display name shown in Sentinel |
| `SearchKey` | string | No | `DCRName` | Column used as the watchlist search key |

### Required RBAC on the managed identity

- **Monitoring Reader** on the subscription (to list DCRs and their
  associations via ARM).
- **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** on the Sentinel resource group
  (watchlist write).

Both are granted by [`Set-RunbookPermissions.ps1`](#set-runbookpermissionsps1).

## Migrate-ForkLayout.ps1

One-shot helper for fork maintainers. The 26.06 restructure moved the
repository from a flat root into grouped folders (`Content/`, `Infra/`,
`Deploy/`, `Tools/`). Tracked files move automatically when you merge or
rebase the restructure (git rename detection reconciles your
customisations). This helper catches stragglers - untracked custom
content or conflict leftovers still sitting at an old path - and moves
them to their new home.

### What it does

- Moves files at the filesystem level (`Move-Item`), which works for both
  tracked and untracked files; git detects the renames for tracked
  content on your next commit.
- Is idempotent: paths already at the new location are skipped. When both
  the old and new path exist (a partial migration), the old folder's
  contents are merged into the new folder and a warning is emitted for
  anything that would collide.
- Does NOT rewrite file contents, regenerate `dependencies.json`, or
  commit. After running it, review `git status`, run
  `./Tools/Build-DependencyManifest.ps1 -Mode Generate`, then commit.

### Parameter reference

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RepoPath` | string | No | Parent of the `Tools/` folder this script lives in | Repository root |
| `AllowDirty` | switch | No | `$false` | Proceed even if the working tree has uncommitted changes. By default the script refuses to run on a dirty tree so the moves are easy to review and revert |

The script uses `[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]`, so `-WhatIf`
previews every move without touching the tree.

### Usage

```powershell
# Preview every move without touching the tree
./Tools/Migrate-ForkLayout.ps1 -WhatIf

# Apply the moves
./Tools/Migrate-ForkLayout.ps1
```

## Documenter scripts

The repository documentation generator lives under `Tools/Documenter/`
(`Export-SentinelInventory.ps1`, `Convert-SentinelInventoryToMarkdown.ps1`,
`Convert-MermaidToImage.ps1`, plus the `Report/` and `Private/` helpers)
and is documented separately. See
[Sentinel Documenter](../Tools/Documenter/Sentinel-Documenter.md) for the
inventory export model, Markdown/Word report generation, and diagram
rendering.
